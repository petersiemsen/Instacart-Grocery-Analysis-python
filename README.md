# Project Overview

In this project, I was to take on the role of an analyst for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store
that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. 
My task was to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies 
for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

The primary coding language used in this project was Python. I created numerous scripts to wrangle, maniupulate, and analyze the data to
develop insight into the company's customers. I also created a number of visualizations using the ___ library to provide clearer context to 
stakeholders when discussing strategic initiatives.
